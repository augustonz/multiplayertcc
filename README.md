This project was made on Unity for a End of Course paper on the different Lag Compensation techniques used on multiplayer games.  

The game is playable and the paper was completed but there are still some improvements that can be done to the project symbolized by the To-Do lists below.


## Implementation To-Do
* Add a GiveUp button on the match
* Fix bug not being able to connect after playing offline
* Add arrow keys support

## My personal To-Do
* Create the toggle pixel art png
* Fix audio mixing between SFXs and music (win is too quiet)
* Fix Error debug logs involving animation layers
* Add instructions maybe
* When typing name on lobby, stop updating values overriden what is being typed
* Create SFXs (Death and small Powerup)
* Create sign pointing right and down pixel art
* Add end screen when match is over
