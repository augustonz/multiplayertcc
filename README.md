## Implementation To-Do

## My personal To-Do
* Create the toggle pixel art png
* Fix audio mixing between SFXs and music (win is too quiet)
* Fix Error debug logs involving animation layers
* When typing name on lobby, stop updating values overriden what is being typed
* Create SFXs (Death and small Powerup)
* Create sign pointing right and down pixel art
* Add end screen when match is over


## Player Feedback To-Do
* Weird things with big buttons depending on resolution
* Study errors in reconciliation
* Add instructions maybe
