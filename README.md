## Implementation To-Do
* Make animations work even without client prediction. (and on the other players)
* Test locally on dedicated server
* Test with actual players
* Make full experiment with actual players

## My personal To-Do
* Create the toggle pixel art png
* Fix audio mixing between SFXs and music (win is too quiet)
* Add Video resolution and fullscreen option
* Fix Error debug logs involving animation layers
* When typing name on lobby, stop updating values overriden what is being typed
* Create SFXs (Death and small Powerup)
* Create sign pointing right and down pixel art
* Create Other levels
* Add end screen when match is over
